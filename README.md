# AdventOfCode 2021

In this repository I will put my solutions to the Advent of Code 2021.
My solutions are mainly written in C++.


## Compiling

I provided a Makefile and a simple bash script to compile the solutions:

```bash
make # compiles all solutions
```

```bash
./compile 3 # compiles solutions A and B for day 3
```
