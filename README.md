# AdventOfCode 2021

In this repository I will put my solutions to the Advent of Code 2021.
I will write solutions to all problems in C++, which can be found
in the C++ directory. I might also write solutions to some problems
in different languages for fun, like x86 MacOS Assembly or golfed JavaScript.
These solutions can be found in their respective directories.


## Compiling

I provided a Makefile and a simple bash script to compile the solutions
for each language:

```bash
cd C++ # or whatever language you want to compile
```

```bash
make # compiles all solutions
```

```bash
./compile 3 # compiles solutions A and B for day 3
```


## Running

I provided a bash script to run the solutions for each language:

```bash
./run 3 # runs solutions A and B for day 3
```
